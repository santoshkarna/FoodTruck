# FoodTruck

Problem: Food Trucks
Create a service that tells the user what types of food trucks might be found near a specific location on a map.
The data is available on DataSF: Food Trucks

Solution: The application is created using the SpringBoot.
The solutions consist only Backend.

Reasons for technical choices:  Java Stack is one of the popular and leading programming language for backend.
Spring Boot makes it easy to create stand-alone, production-grade Spring based Applications that you can "just run".
We take an opinionated view of the Spring platform and third-party libraries so you can get started with minimum fuss. 
Most Spring Boot applications need minimal Spring configuration.

Features
Create stand-alone Spring applications

Embed Tomcat, Jetty or Undertow directly (no need to deploy WAR files)

Provide opinionated 'starter' dependencies to simplify your build configuration

Automatically configure Spring and 3rd party libraries whenever possible

Provide production-ready features such as metrics, health checks, and externalized configuration

Absolutely no code generation and no requirement for XML configuration
The Backend architecture uses the MVC design patterns
